Balloon Wars is an exciting multiplayer cross-platform mobile game developed by [Omer Cohen Shor](https://github.com/OmerCS8) and [Alon Shakaroff](https://github.com/AlonShakaroff) as the final project for the computer science degree program at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yaffo. The game was created using Unity, Photon, and PlayFab.

In this game, players are tasked with eliminating their opponents by popping their balloons while maneuvering in the air using two elements of control - the amount of helium in the balloons and left/right arrow keys to navigate. Each player also has a dart stick that can be used to launch arrows at other players' balloons. The last player left with balloons is declared the winner.

The game features stunning graphics and realistic physics simulations, including dynamic balloon physics and projectile motion. With room management and creation capabilities, as well as private room options, players can easily connect and play with their friends in customized game environments.

Balloon Wars is a thrilling multiplayer experience that is sure to keep players engaged and entertained. So why wait? Join the fight, grab your dart stick, and let the balloon wars begin!
